# App integration scripts for [Contexter]

## Synopsis

The API allows you to add support for any app you use in workflows you want to fully capture. You write a JavaScript for Automation script to implement our interface. And voila, you've just added support for your favourite app we didn't support out of the box.

Not a developer? Easy, just make a request, and see it developed by the community.
